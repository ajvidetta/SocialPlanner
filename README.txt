Hello!

while most programs tend to work straight away, due to my inexperience in the field, mine may not.

to run the program, go to    dist -> socialPlanNewHomie

this should open the app, to initialize a new timetable click new, to edit or delete timetables click edit and to compare timetables click match

the program SHOULD come with the timtables i was given last week. to compare these, i added a nifty button in the top left corner of the MATCH screen labeled "n" for noods.

NOTE:
    unfortunatly, once youve made the new timetable, to view it youll need to close out the app and re-open it, the same steps must be taken when deleting a timtable as well

for additional information, you know where you reach me.
